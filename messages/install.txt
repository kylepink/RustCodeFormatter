RustCodeFromatter is a plugin for Sublime Text 3 which allows the formatting of
rust code. This plugin is a binding for rust-style. rust-style is a work in
progress and still has formatting issues and bugs.

The default key to format selected lines is "ctrl+k, ctrl+f". 

Setup
------------
1. Install the Rust sublime package (for syntax highlighting):
   https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Rust
2. Clone and compile rust-style: https://github.com/sp0/rust-style
3. Either place the built rust-style executable into your search path,
   or alternatively configure the absolute path of rust-style:
      1. Open the command pallete by pressing "Ctrl+Shift+P" or through the menu
         Tools -> Command Pallete.
      2. Enter/select "Rust Code Formatter: Set Path".
      3. An input field will appear with the default content "rust-style".
         Replace with an absolute path, ie "C:\directory\rust-style.exe" and
         press enter.
